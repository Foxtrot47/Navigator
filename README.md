# Navigator

College Navigation using Augmented Reality with Unity

This is a simple project I made in College as my final year Project

Its not 100% accurate but gets the job done

You need a QR to start this app in the first place. 
I have set Main Gate and Portico as startup so generate a QR from that string.

You can fork this project and modify the map and location markers to be used on other places

this is based on @janilein Indoor Navigation
